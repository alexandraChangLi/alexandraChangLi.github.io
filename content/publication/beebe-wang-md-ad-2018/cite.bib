 abstract = {Systematic modeling of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology based on brain gene expression would provide valuable insights into the disease. However, relative scarcity and regional heterogeneity of brain gene expression and neuropathology datasets obscure the ability to robustly identify expression markers. We propose MD-AD (Multi-task Deep learning for AD) to effectively combine heterogeneous AD datasets by simultaneously modeling multiple phenotypes with shared layers. MD-AD leads to an 8% and 5% reduction in mean squared error over MLP for predicting counts of two AD hallmarks: plaques and tangles. It also leads to a 40% and 30% reduction in classiﬁcation error over MLP for two common staging systems for AD: CERAD score and Braak stage. Additionally, MD-AD's network representation tends to better capture known metabolic pathways, including some AD-related pathways. Together, these results indicate that MD-AD is particularly useful for learning expressive network representations from heterogeneous and sparsely labeled AD data.},
