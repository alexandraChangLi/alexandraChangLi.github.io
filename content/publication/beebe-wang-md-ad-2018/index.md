abstract: "Systematic modeling of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology based on
  brain gene expression would provide valuable insights into the disease. However,
  relative scarcity and regional heterogeneity of brain gene expression and neuropathology
  datasets obscure the ability to robustly identify expression markers. We propose
  MD-AD (Multi-task Deep learning for AD) to effectively combine heterogeneous AD
  datasets by simultaneously modeling multiple phenotypes with shared layers. MD-AD
  leads to an 8% and 5% reduction in mean squared error over MLP for predicting counts
  of two AD hallmarks: plaques and tangles. It also leads to a 40% and 30% reduction
  in classiﬁcation error over MLP for two common staging systems for AD: CERAD score
  and Braak stage. Additionally, MD-AD's network representation tends to better capture
  known metabolic pathways, including some AD-related pathways. Together, these results
  indicate that MD-AD is particularly useful for learning expressive network representations
  from heterogeneous and sparsely labeled AD data."
