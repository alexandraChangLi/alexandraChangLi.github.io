 abstract = {The superior performances of pre-trained foundation models in various visual tasks underscore their potential to enhance the 2D models’ open-vocabulary ability. Existing methods explore analogous applications in the 3D space. However, most of them only center around knowledge extraction from singular foundation models, which limits the open-vocabulary ability of 3D models. We hypothesize that leveraging complementary pre-trained knowledge from various foundation models can improve knowledge transfer from 2D pre-trained visual language models to the 3D space. In this work, we propose FM-OV3D, a method of Foundation Model-based Cross-modal Knowledge Blending for Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection, which improves the open-vocabulary localization and recognition abilities of 3D model by blending knowledge from multiple pretrained foundation models, achieving true open-vocabulary without facing constraints from original 3D datasets. Specifically, to learn the open-vocabulary 3D localization ability, we adopt the open-vocabulary localization knowledge of the Grounded-Segment-Anything model. For open-vocabulary 3D recognition ability, We leverage the knowledge of generative foundation models, including GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion models, and cross-modal discriminative models like CLIP. The experimental results on two popular benchmarks for open-vocabulary 3D object detection show that our model efficiently learns knowledge from multiple foundation models to enhance the open-vocabulary ability of the 3D model and successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary 3D object detection tasks.
