abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Field Expectation Maximization (EFEM), a
  simple, effective, and robust geometric algorithm that can segment objects in 3D
  scenes without annotations or training on scenes. We achieve such unsupervised segmentation
  by exploiting single object shape priors. We make two novel steps in that direction.
  First, we introduce equivariant shape representations to this problem to eliminate
  the complexity induced by the variation in object configuration. Second, we propose
  a novel EM algorithm that can iteratively refine segmentation masks using the equivariant
  shape prior. We collect a novel real dataset Chairs and Mugs that contains various
  object configurations and novel scenes in order to verify the effectiveness and
  robustness of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
  consistent and robust performance across different scenes where the (weakly) supervised
  methods may fail. Code and data available at https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~leijh/projects/efem
