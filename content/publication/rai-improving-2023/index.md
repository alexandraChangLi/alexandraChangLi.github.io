abstract: 'Language-supervised object detection typically uses descriptive captions
  from human-annotated datasets. However, in-the-wild captions take on wider styles
  of language. We analyze one particular ubiquitous form of language: narrative. We
  study the differences in linguistic structure and visual-text alignment in narrative
  and descriptive captions and find we can classify descriptive and narrative style
  captions using linguistic features such as part of speech, rhetoric structure theory,
  and multimodal discourse. Then, we use this to select captions from which to extract
  imagelevel labels as supervision for weakly supervised object detection. We also
  improve the quality of extracted labels by filtering based on proximity to verb
  types for both descriptive and narrative captions.'
