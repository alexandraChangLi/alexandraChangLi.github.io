 abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of 3D human reconstruction from 2D evidence. Although this is an inherently ambiguous problem, the majority of recent works avoid the uncertainty modeling and typically regress a single estimate for a given input. In contrast to that, in this work, we propose to embrace the reconstruction ambiguity and we recast the problem as learning a mapping from the input to a distribution of plausible 3D poses. Our approach is based on the normalizing ﬂows model and offers a series of advantages. For conventional applications, where a single 3D estimate is required, our formulation allows for efﬁcient mode computation. Using the mode leads to performance that is comparable with the state of the art among deterministic unimodal regression models. Simultaneously, since we have access to the likelihood of each sample, we demonstrate that our model is useful in a series of downstream tasks, where we leverage the probabilistic nature of the prediction as a tool for more accurate estimation. These tasks include reconstruction from multiple uncalibrated views, as well as human model ﬁtting, where our model acts as a powerful image-based prior for mesh recovery. Our results validate the importance of probabilistic modeling, and indicate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of settings.
