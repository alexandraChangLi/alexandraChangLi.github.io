abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) is a subcortical structure
  involved in arousal and cognition being explored as a deep brain stimulation (DBS)
  target for Alzheimer’s disease and other disorders. Given the small size of the
  NBM and variability between patients, accurate patient-speciﬁc targeting for DBS
  is needed. Accurate patient-speciﬁc manual segmentation is possible but requires
  high resolution 7T MRI. Therefore, the current standard is a non-patient-speciﬁc
  probabilistic atlas (Zaborszky 2008). METHODS: Paired 3T and 7T MRI datasets of
  21 healthy subjects were obtained and the NBM was expertly segmented on 7T MRI.
  The 7T NBM segmentation was then used on the 3T MRI. To increase generalizability,
  we augmented the dataset to a total of 210 images. An external dataset of 14 patients
  with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was used to validate the network’s performance
  on brains with pathological changes (Alvim 2016). A 3D-Unet convolutional neural
  network was constructed, and a 5-fold cross-validation was performed for model selection.
  The model was evaluated on healthy subjects using the held-out test dataset and
  on the external dataset of 14 TLE patients. RESULTS: When tested on the held-out
  dataset, the deep learning network demonstrated signiﬁcantly improved dice coefﬁcient
  compared against the probabilistic atlas for both healthy subjects (0.68 ± 0.08,
  0.47 ± 0.06) and patients with TLE (0.63 ± 0.08, 0.38 ± 0.19). Additionally, the
  centroid distance was signiﬁcantly decreased when using the network in patients
  with TLE (1.22 ± 0.33 mm, 3.25 ± 2.57 mm). CONCLUSIONS: We developed the ﬁrst network,
  to our knowledge, for automatic and accurate patient-speciﬁc segmentation of the
  NBM using deep learning. The proposed network has less error than accepted targeting
  margins. This segmentation strategy allows accurate patient-speciﬁc targeting of
  the NBM for DBS.'
