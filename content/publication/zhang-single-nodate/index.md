abstract: In this paper, we present Iterative Symmetry Completion Network (ISCNet),
  a single depth-image shape completion method that exploits reflective symmetry cues
  to obtain more detailed shapes. The efficacy of single depth-image shape completion
  methods is often sensitive to the accuracy of the symmetry plane. ISCNet therefore
  jointly estimates the symmetry plane and shape completion iteratively; more complete
  shapes contribute to more robust symmetry plane estimates and vice versa. Furthermore,
  our shape completion method operates in the image domain, enabling more efficient
  high-resolution, detailed geometry reconstruction. We perform the shape completion
  from pairs of viewpoints, reflected across the symmetry plane, predicted by a reinforcement
  learning agent to improve robustness and to simultaneously explicitly leverage symmetry.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of ISCNet on a variety of object categories on
  both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.
