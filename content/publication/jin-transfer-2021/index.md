abstract: With recent advances in multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomic and
  proteomic technologies, cell segmentation is becoming a crucial step in biomedical
  image analysis. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) have achieved
  great success in nuclei segmentation in in vitro imaging. Nevertheless, it remains
  challenging to perform similar tasks on in situ tissue images with more cluttered
  cells of diverse shapes. To address this issue, we propose a novel transfer learning,
  cell segmentation framework incorporating shape-aware features in a deep learning
  model, with multi-level watershed and morphological post-processing steps. Our results
  show that incorporation of geometric features improves generalizability to segmenting
  cells in in situ tissue images, using solely in vitro images as training data.
