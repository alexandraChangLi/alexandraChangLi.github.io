We present data from the Heart Rate Variability and Emotion Regulation (HRV-ER) randomized clinical trial testing effects of HRV biofeedback. Younger (N = 121) and older (N = 72) participants completed baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including T

-weighted, resting and emotion regulation task functional MRI (fMRI), pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (

H MRS). During fMRI scans, physiological measures (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and end-tidal CO

) were continuously acquired. Participants were randomized to either increase heart rate oscillations or decrease heart rate oscillations during daily sessions. After 5 weeks of HRV biofeedback, they repeated the baseline measurements in addition to new measures (ultimatum game fMRI, training mimicking during blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and PCASL fMRI). Participants also wore a wristband sensor to estimate sleep time. Psychological assessment comprised three cognitive tests and ten questionnaires related to emotional well-being. A subset (N = 104) provided plasma samples pre- and post-intervention that were assayed for amyloid and tau. Data is publicly available via the OpenNeuro data sharing platform.},
