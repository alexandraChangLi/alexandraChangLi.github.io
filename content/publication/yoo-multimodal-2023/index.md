abstract: Abstract  We present data from the Heart Rate Variability and Emotion Regulation
  (HRV-ER) randomized clinical trial testing effects of HRV biofeedback. Younger (N = 121)
  and older (N = 72) participants completed baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
  including T 1 -weighted, resting and emotion regulation task functional MRI (fMRI),
  pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), and proton magnetic resonance
  spectroscopy ( 1 H MRS). During fMRI scans, physiological measures (blood pressure,
  pulse, respiration, and end-tidal CO 2 ) were continuously acquired. Participants
  were randomized to either increase heart rate oscillations or decrease heart rate
  oscillations during daily sessions. After 5 weeks of HRV biofeedback, they repeated
  the baseline measurements in addition to new measures (ultimatum game fMRI, training
  mimicking during blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and PCASL fMRI). Participants
  also wore a wristband sensor to estimate sleep time. Psychological assessment comprised
  three cognitive tests and ten questionnaires related to emotional well-being. A
  subset (N = 104) provided plasma samples pre- and post-intervention that were assayed
  for amyloid and tau. Data is publicly available via the OpenNeuro data sharing platform.
