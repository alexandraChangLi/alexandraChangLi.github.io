abstract: We present DreamPose, a diffusion-based method for generating animated fashion
  videos from still images. Given an image and a sequence of human body poses, our
  method synthesizes a video containing both human and fabric motion. To achieve this,
  we transform a pretrained text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) into a pose-and-image
  guided video synthesis model, using a novel fine-tuning strategy, a set of architectural
  changes to support the added conditioning signals, and techniques to encourage temporal
  consistency. We fine-tune on a collection of fashion videos from the UBC Fashion
  dataset. We evaluate our method on a variety of clothing styles and poses, and demonstrate
  that our method produces state-of-the-art results on fashion video animation.Video
  results are available on our project page.
