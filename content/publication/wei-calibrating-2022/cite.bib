 abstract = {The classiﬁcation of histopathology images fundamentally differs from traditional image classiﬁcation tasks because histopathology images naturally exhibit a range of diagnostic features, resulting in a diverse range of annotator agreement levels. However, examples with high annotator disagreement are often either assigned the majority label or discarded entirely when training histopathology image classiﬁers. This widespread practice often yields classiﬁers that do not account for example difﬁculty and exhibit poor model calibration. In this paper, we ask: can we improve model calibration by endowing histopathology image classiﬁers with inductive biases about example difﬁculty? We propose several label smoothing methods that utilize per-image annotator agreement. Though our methods are simple, we ﬁnd that they substantially improve model calibration, while maintaining (or even improving) accuracy. For colorectal polyp classiﬁcation, a common yet challenging task in gastrointestinal pathology, we ﬁnd that our proposed agreement-aware label smoothing methods reduce calibration error by almost 70%. Moreover, we ﬁnd that using model conﬁdence as a proxy for annotator agreement also improves calibration and accuracy, suggesting that datasets without multiple annotators can still beneﬁt from our proposed label smoothing methods via our proposed conﬁdence-aware label smoothing methods.},
