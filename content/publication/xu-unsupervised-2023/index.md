abstract: 'Representing a 3D shape with a set of primitives can aid perception of
  structure, improve robotic object manipulation, and enable editing, stylization,
  and compression of 3D shapes. Existing methods either use simple parametric primitives
  or learn a generative shape space of parts. Both have limitations: parametric primitives
  lead to coarse approximations, while learned parts offer too little control over
  the decomposition. We instead propose to decompose shapes using a library of 3D
  parts provided by the user, giving full control over the choice of parts. The library
  can contain parts with high-quality geometry that are suitable for a given category,
  resulting in meaningful decompositions with clean geometry. The type of decomposition
  can also be controlled through the choice of parts in the library. Our method works
  via a self-supervised approach that iteratively retrieves parts from the library
  and reÔ¨Ånes their placements. We show that this approach gives higher reconstruction
  accuracy and more desirable decompositions than existing approaches. Additionally,
  we show how the decomposition can be controlled through the part library by using
  different part libraries to reconstruct the same shapes.'
