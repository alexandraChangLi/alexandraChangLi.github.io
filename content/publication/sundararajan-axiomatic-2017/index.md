abstract: We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to
  its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify
  two fundamental axioms—Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution
  methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisﬁed by most known attribution
  methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use
  the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients.
  Our method requires no modiﬁcation to the original network and is extremely simple
  to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply
  this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry
  model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network,
  and to enable users to engage with models better.
