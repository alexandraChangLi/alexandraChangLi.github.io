abstract: 'Purpose: False positives in digital mammography screening lead to high
  recall rates, resulting in unnecessary medical procedures to patients and health
  care costs. This study aimed to investigate the revolutionary deep learning methods
  to distinguish recalled but benign mammography images from negative exams and those
  with malignancy.'
