 abstract = {We investigate size-induced distribution shifts in graphs and assess their impact on the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to generalize to larger graphs relative to the training data. Existing literature presents conflicting conclusions on GNNs’ size generalizability, primarily due to disparities in application domains and underlying assumptions concerning size-induced distribution shifts. Motivated by this, we take a data-driven approach: we focus on real biological datasets and seek to characterize the types of size-induced distribution shifts. Diverging from prior approaches, we adopt a spectral perspective and identify that spectrum differences induced by size are related to differences in subgraph patterns (e.g., average cycle lengths). We further find that common GNNs cannot capture these subgraph patterns, resulting in performance decline when testing on larger graphs. Based on these spectral insights, we introduce and compare three model-agnostic strategies aimed at making GNNs aware of important subgraph patterns to enhance their size generalizability: self-supervision, augmentation, and size-insensitive attention. Our empirical results reveal that all strategies enhance GNNs’ size generalizability, with simple size-insensitive attention surprisingly emerging as the most effective method. Notably, this strategy substantially enhances graph classification performance on large test graphs, which are 2-10 times larger than the training graphs, resulting in an improvement in F1 scores by up to 8%.},
