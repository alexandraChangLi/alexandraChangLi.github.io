abstract: From just a short glance at a video, we can often tell whether a person’s
  action is intentional or not. Can we train a model to recognize this? We introduce
  a dataset of in-thewild videos of unintentional action, as well as a suite of tasks
  for recognizing, localizing, and anticipating its onset. We train a supervised neural
  network as a baseline and analyze its performance compared to human consistency
  on the tasks. We also investigate self-supervised representations that leverage
  natural signals in our dataset, and show the effectiveness of an approach that uses
  the intrinsic speed of video to perform competitively with highly-supervised pretraining.
  However, a signiﬁcant gap between machine and human performance remains.
