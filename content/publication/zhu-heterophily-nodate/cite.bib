 abstract = {Recently, there has been interest in understanding the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on input graphs exhibiting heterophily, or the tendency for nodes of different classes to connect. Initial findings showed that many standard GNN models struggled on certain benchmark datasets exhibiting high heterophily, prompting research into existing and novel GNN designs that improved learning in these contexts. However, further analyses revealed that certain highly heterophilous settings did not challenge GNNs without these specialized designs, raising questions about the true factors causing performance degradation. In this work, we first review various GNN designs proposed for handling graphs with heterophily, and examine their connections to other GNN research objectives such as robustness, fairness, and oversmoothing avoidance. Next, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the specific heterophilous graph conditions under which GNNs can and cannot perform effectively. Our analysis reveals that although high heterophily does not universally impede conventional GNNs, unique challenges in heterophilous graphs, particularly the intertwined effects with low-degree nodes and complex compatibility patterns, warrant GNN designs specifically tailored to heterophily. In conclusion, we discuss future research directions aimed at advancing the understanding of the impact of heterophily on GNNs across a broader range of contexts.},
