abstract: Recently, there has been interest in understanding the performance of Graph
  Neural Networks (GNNs) on input graphs exhibiting heterophily, or the tendency for
  nodes of different classes to connect. Initial findings showed that many standard
  GNN models struggled on certain benchmark datasets exhibiting high heterophily,
  prompting research into existing and novel GNN designs that improved learning in
  these contexts. However, further analyses revealed that certain highly heterophilous
  settings did not challenge GNNs without these specialized designs, raising questions
  about the true factors causing performance degradation. In this work, we first review
  various GNN designs proposed for handling graphs with heterophily, and examine their
  connections to other GNN research objectives such as robustness, fairness, and oversmoothing
  avoidance. Next, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the specific heterophilous
  graph conditions under which GNNs can and cannot perform effectively. Our analysis
  reveals that although high heterophily does not universally impede conventional
  GNNs, unique challenges in heterophilous graphs, particularly the intertwined effects
  with low-degree nodes and complex compatibility patterns, warrant GNN designs specifically
  tailored to heterophily. In conclusion, we discuss future research directions aimed
  at advancing the understanding of the impact of heterophily on GNNs across a broader
  range of contexts.
