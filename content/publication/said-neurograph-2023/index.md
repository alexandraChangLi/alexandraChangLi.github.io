abstract: Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional
  functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological
  conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly
  modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning
  methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step
  in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the
  transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain remains surprisingly
  under-explored due to the expansive preprocessing pipeline and large parameter search
  space for graph-based datasets construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph,
  a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets that span multiple categories
  of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation
  search space by crafting 35 datasets within both static and dynamic contexts, running
  in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic
  frameworks for learning on dynamic as well as static graphs. Our extensive experiments
  lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features,
  incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs
  lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data
  driven Neuroimaging, we offer a comprehensive open source Python package that includes
  the datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.
