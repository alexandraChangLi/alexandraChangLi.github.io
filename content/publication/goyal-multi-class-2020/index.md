abstract: Melanoma is clinically diï¬ƒcult to distinguish from common benign skin lesions,
  particularly melanocytic naevus and seborrhoeic keratosis. The dermoscopic appearance
  of these lesions has huge intra-class variations and high inter-class visual similarities.
  Most current research is focusing on single-class segmentation irrespective of classes
  of skin lesions. In this work, we evaluate the performance of deep learning on multi-class
  segmentation of ISIC-2017 challenge dataset, which consists of 2,750 dermoscopic
  images. We propose an end-to-end solution using fully convolutional networks (FCNs)
  for multi-class semantic segmentation to automatically segment the melanoma, seborrhoeic
  keratosis and naevus. To improve the performance of FCNs, transfer learning and
  a hybrid loss function are used. We evaluate the performance of the deep learning
  segmentation methods for multi-class segmentation and lesion diagnosis (with post-processing
  method) on the testing set of the ISIC-2017 challenge dataset. The results showed
  that the two-tier level transfer learning FCN-8s achieved the overall best result
  with Dice score of 78.5% in a naevus category, 65.3% in melanoma, and 55.7% in seborrhoeic
  keratosis in multiclass segmentation and Accuracy of 84.62% for recognition of melanoma
  in lesion diagnosis.
