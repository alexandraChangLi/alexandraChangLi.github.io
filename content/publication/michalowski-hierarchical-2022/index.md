abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the biomedical research
  community in developing machine learning models and methods that can automatically
  assign diagnostic codes (ICD) to patient stays based on the information in their
  Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, despite the recent advances, accurate
  automatic classiﬁcation of diagnostic codes continues to face challenges, especially
  for low-prior diagnostic codes. To alleviate the problem, we propose to leverage
  information in the diagnostic hierarchy and better utilize the dependencies among
  diseases in this hierarchy. We develop a new hierarchical deep multi-task learning
  method that learns classiﬁcation models for multiple diagnostic codes at the diﬀerent
  levels of abstraction in the disease hierarchy while allowing the transfer of information
  from highlevel nodes, more general diagnoses codes to the low-level ones, more speciﬁc
  diagnostic codes. After that, we reﬁne the initial hierarchical model by utilizing
  the relations and information that can discriminate better between competing diseases.
  Our empirical results show that our new method and its reﬁnement outperform baseline
  machine learning architectures that do not leverage the hierarchical structure of
  target diagnoses tasks or disease-disease relationships.
