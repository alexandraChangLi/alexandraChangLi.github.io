abstract: 'Recent work has shown great promise in explaining neural network behavior.
  In particular, feature attribution methods explain which features were most important
  to a model’s prediction on a given input. However, for many tasks, simply knowing
  which features were important to a model’s prediction may not provide enough insight
  to understand model behavior. The interactions between features within the model
  may better help us understand not only the model, but also why certain features
  are more important than others. In this work, we present Integrated Hessians2: an
  extension of Integrated Gradients that explains pairwise feature interactions in
  neural networks. Integrated Hessians overcomes several theoretical limitations of
  previous methods to explain interactions, and unlike such previous methods is not
  limited to a speciﬁc architecture or class of neural network. Additionally, we ﬁnd
  that our method is faster than existing methods when the number of features is large,
  and outperforms previous methods on existing quantitative benchmarks.'
