 abstract = {Recent work has shown great promise in explaining neural network behavior. In particular, feature attribution methods explain which features were most important to a model’s prediction on a given input. However, for many tasks, simply knowing which features were important to a model’s prediction may not provide enough insight to understand model behavior. The interactions between features within the model may better help us understand not only the model, but also why certain features are more important than others. In this work, we present Integrated Hessians2: an extension of Integrated Gradients that explains pairwise feature interactions in neural networks. Integrated Hessians overcomes several theoretical limitations of previous methods to explain interactions, and unlike such previous methods is not limited to a speciﬁc architecture or class of neural network. Additionally, we ﬁnd that our method is faster than existing methods when the number of features is large, and outperforms previous methods on existing quantitative benchmarks.},
 annote = {This paper is gold. It propose to take the second-order derivative of the integrated gradient, into the integrated hessian matrix. These scores calculated from the hessian matrix correspond to two features’ interactions.
The experiment results are promising and have wide application.
I did not inspect the detailed math deduction part but intuitively these theorems seem correct.
It has a wide further application.},
