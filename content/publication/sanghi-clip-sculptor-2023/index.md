abstract: Recent works have demonstrated that natural language can be used to generate
  and edit 3D shapes. However, these methods generate shapes with limited fidelity
  and diversity. We introduce CLIP-Sculptor, a method to address these constraints
  by producing high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes without the need for (text, shape)
  pairs during training. CLIP-Sculptor achieves this in a multi-resolution approach
  that first generates in a low-dimensional latent space and then upscales to a higher
  resolution for improved shape fidelity. For improved shape diversity, we use a discrete
  latent space which is modeled using a transformer conditioned on CLIPâ€™s image-text
  embedding space. We also present a novel variant of classifier-free guidance, which
  improves the accuracy-diversity trade-off. Finally, we perform extensive experiments
  demonstrating that CLIP-Sculptor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
