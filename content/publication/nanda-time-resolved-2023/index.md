abstract: Much of systems neuroscience posits the functional importance of brain activity
  patterns that lack natural scales of sizes, durations, or frequencies. The Ô¨Åeld
  has developed prominent, and sometimes competing, explanations for the nature of
  this scale-free activity. Here, we reconcile these explanations across species and
  modalities. First, we link estimates of excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance with
  time-resolved correlation of distributed brain activity. Second, we develop an unbiased
  method for sampling time series constrained by this time-resolved correlation. Third,
  we use this method to show that estimates of E-I balance account for diverse scale-free
  phenomena without need to attribute additional function or importance to these phenomena.
  Collectively, our results simplify existing explanations of scale-free brain activity
  and provide stringent tests on future theories that seek to transcend these explanations.
