abstract: There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires
  many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and
  training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the
  available annotated samples more eﬃciently. The architecture consists of a contracting
  path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.
  We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms
  the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge
  for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the
  same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and
  DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large
  margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less
  than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caﬀe) and the trained
  networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.
