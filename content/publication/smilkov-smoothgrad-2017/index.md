abstract: 'Explaining the output of a deep network remains a challenge. In the case
  of an image classiﬁer, one type of explanation is to identify pixels that strongly
  inﬂuence the ﬁnal decision. A starting point for this strategy is the gradient of
  the class score function with respect to the input image. This gradient can be interpreted
  as a sensitivity map, and there are several techniques that elaborate on this basic
  idea. This paper makes two contributions: it introduces SMOOTHGRAD, a simple method
  that can help visually sharpen gradient-based sensitivity maps, and it discusses
  lessons in the visualization of these maps. We publish the code for our experiments
  and a website with our results.'
