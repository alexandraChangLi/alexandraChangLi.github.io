abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis.
  In recent years, deep learning based approaches have shown exceptional performance
  when trained on a fully-annotated dataset. However, data annotation is often a signiﬁcant
  bottleneck, especially for 3D medical images. Active learning (AL) is a promising
  solution for eﬃcient annotation but requires an initial set of labeled samples to
  start active selection. When the entire data pool is unlabeled, how do we select
  the samples to annotate as our initial set? This is also known as the cold-start
  AL, which permits only one chance to request annotations from experts without access
  to previously annotated data. Cold-start AL is highly relevant in many practical
  scenarios but has been under-explored, especially for 3D medical segmentation tasks
  requiring substantial annotation eﬀort. In this paper, we present a benchmark named
  COLosSAL by evaluating six cold-start AL strategies on ﬁve 3D medical image segmentation
  tasks from the public Medical Segmentation Decathlon collection. We perform a thorough
  performance analysis and explore important open questions for cold-start AL, such
  as the impact of budget on diﬀerent strategies. Our results show that cold-start
  AL is still an unsolved problem for 3D segmentation tasks but some important trends
  have been observed. The code repository, data partitions, and baseline results for
  the complete benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/MedICL-VU/COLosSAL.
