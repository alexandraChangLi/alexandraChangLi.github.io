 abstract = {A diffusion model learns to predict a vector ﬁeld of gradients. We propose to apply chain rule on the learned gradients, and back-propagate the score of a diffusion model through the Jacobian of a differentiable renderer, which we instantiate to be a voxel radiance ﬁeld. This setup aggregates 2D scores at multiple camera viewpoints into a 3D score, and repurposes a pretrained 2D model for 3D data generation. We identify a technical challenge of distribution mismatch that arises in this application, and propose a novel estimation mechanism to resolve it. We run our algorithm on several offthe-shelf diffusion image generative models, including the recently released Stable Diffusion trained on the large-scale LAION 5B dataset.},
