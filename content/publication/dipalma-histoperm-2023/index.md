abstract: 'Deep learning has been effective for histology image analysis in digital
  pathology. However, many current deep learning approaches require large, strongly-
  or weakly labeled images and regions of interest, which can be time-consuming and
  resource-intensive to obtain. To address this challenge, we present HistoPerm, a
  view generation method for representation learning using joint embedding architectures
  that enhances representation learning for histology images. HistoPerm permutes augmented
  views of patches extracted from whole-slide histology images to improve classiﬁcation
  performance. We evaluated the effectiveness of HistoPerm on 2 histology image datasets
  for Celiac disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma, using 3 widely used joint embedding
  architecture-based representation learning methods: BYOL, SimCLR, and VICReg. Our
  results show that HistoPerm consistently improves patch- and slide-level classiﬁcation
  performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Speciﬁcally, for patch-level
  classiﬁcation accuracy on the Celiac disease dataset, HistoPerm boosts BYOL and
  VICReg by 8% and SimCLR by 3%. On the Renal Cell Carcinoma dataset, patch-level
  classiﬁcation accuracy is increased by 2% for BYOL and VICReg, and by 1% for SimCLR.
  In addition, on the Celiac disease dataset, models with HistoPerm outperform the
  fully supervised baseline model by 6%, 5%, and 2% for BYOL, SimCLR, and VICReg,
  respectively. For the Renal Cell Carcinoma dataset, HistoPerm lowers the classiﬁcation
  accuracy gap for the models up to 10% relative to the fully supervised baseline.
  These ﬁndings suggest that HistoPerm can be a valuable tool for improving representation
  learning of histopathology features when access to labeled data is limited and can
  lead to whole-slide classiﬁcation results that are comparable to or superior to
  fully supervised methods.'
