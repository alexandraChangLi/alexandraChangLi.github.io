abstract: Neural networks (NN) for single-view 3D reconstruction (SVR) have gained
  in popularity. Recent work points out that for SVR, most cutting-edge NNs have limited
  performance on reconstructing unseen objects because they rely primarily on recognition
  (i.e., classification-based methods) rather than shape reconstruction. To understand
  this issue in depth, we provide a systematic study on when and why NNs prefer recognition
  to reconstruction and vice versa. Our finding shows that a leading factor in determining
  recognition versus reconstruction is how dispersed the training data is. Thus, we
  introduce the dispersion score, a new data-driven metric, to quantify this leading
  factor and study its effect on NNs. We hypothesize that NNs are biased toward recognition
  when training images are more dispersed and training shapes are less dispersed.
  Our hypothesis is supported and the dispersion score is proved effective through
  our experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets. We show that the proposed metric
  is a principal way to analyze reconstruction quality and provides novel information
  in addition to the conventional reconstruction score.
