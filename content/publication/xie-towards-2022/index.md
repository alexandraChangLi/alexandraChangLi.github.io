abstract: Artificial Intelligence, particularly through recent advancements in deep
  learning (DL), has achieved exceptional performances in many tasks in fields such
  as natural language processing and computer vision. For certain high-stake domains,
  in addition to desirable performance metrics, a high level of interpretability is
  often required in order for AI to be reliably utilized. Unfortunately, the black
  box nature of DL models prevents researchers from providing explicative descriptions
  for a DL model’s reasoning process and decisions. In this work, we propose a novel
  framework utilizing Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning that can provide
  global explanations for decisions made by a Reinforcement Learning model and capture
  intuitive tendencies that the model follows by summarizing the model’s decision-making
  process.
