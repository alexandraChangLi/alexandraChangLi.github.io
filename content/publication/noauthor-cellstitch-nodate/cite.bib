 abstract = {Methods: To address these challenges, we formulate the problem of finding cell correspondence 23 across layers with a novel optimal transport (OT) approach. We propose CellStitch, a flexible 24 pipeline that segments cells from 3D images without requiring large amounts of 3D training 25 data. We further extend our method to interpolate internal slices from highly anisotropic cell 26 images to recover isotropic cell morphology. 27
Results: We evaluated the performance of CellStitch through eight 3D plant microscopic 28 datasets with diverse anisotropic levels and cell shapes. CellStitch substantially outperforms the 29 state-of-the art methods on anisotropic images, and achieves comparable segmentation quality 30 against competing methods in isotropic setting. We benchmarked and reported 3D segmenta31 tion results of all the methods with instance-level precision, recall and average precision (AP) 32 metrics. 33
Conclusion: The proposed OT-based 3D segmentation pipeline outperformed the existing 1},
