 abstract = {Large language models can produce powerful contextual representations that lead to improvements across many NLP tasks. Since these models are typically guided by a sequence of learned self attention mechanisms and may comprise undesired inductive biases, it is paramount to be able to explore what the attention has learned. While static analyses of these models lead to targeted insights, interactive tools are more dynamic and can help humans better gain an intuition for the modelinternal reasoning process. We present EXBERT, an interactive tool named after the popular BERT language model, that provides insights into the meaning of the contextual representations by matching a human-speciﬁed input to similar contexts in a large annotated dataset. By aggregating the annotations of the matching similar contexts, EXBERT helps intuitively explain what each attention-head has learned.},
 annote = {Summary: This paper propose a visualization tool focusing on BERT model.
It claims that it utilize linguistic annotations, interactive masking and nearest neighbor search. But I think its highlight lies in the nearest neighbor search and utilize various types of heads and embeddings for calculation.
The visualization results support their claims while whether it can be transferred to other types of transformers can be questionable, since not all data processed by transformer has this direct detailed meaning. For example, when processing point clouds, there are individual points that need to be considered.},
