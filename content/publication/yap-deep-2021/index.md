abstract: 'There has been a substantial amount of research involving computer methods
  and technology for the detection and recognition of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs),
  but there is a lack of systematic comparisons of state-of-the-art deep learning
  object detection frameworks applied to this problem. DFUC2020 provided participants
  with a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2,000 images for training and 2,000 images
  for testing. This paper sum­ marizes the results of DFUC2020 by comparing the deep
  learning-based algorithms proposed by the winning teams: Faster R–CNN, three variants
  of Faster R–CNN and an ensemble method; YOLOv3; YOLOv5; EfficientDet; and a new
  Cascade Attention Network. For each deep learning method, we provide a detailed
  description of model architecture, parameter settings for training and additional
  stages including pre-processing, data augmentation and post-processing. We provide
  a comprehensive evaluation for each method. All the methods required a data augmentation
  stage to increase the number of images available for training and a post-processing
  stage to remove false positives. The best performance was obtained from Deformable
  Convolution, a variant of Faster R–CNN, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.6940
  and an F1-Score of 0.7434. Finally, we demonstrate that the ensemble method based
  on different deep learning methods can enhance the F1-Score but not the mAP.'
