 abstract = {Computing dense pixel-to-pixel image correspondences is a fundamental task of computer vision. Often, the objective is to align image pairs from the same semantic category for manipulation or segmentation purposes. Despite achieving superior performance, existing deep learning alignment methods cannot cluster images; consequently, clustering and pairing images needed to be a separate laborious and expensive step.},
