abstract: Computing dense pixel-to-pixel image correspondences is a fundamental task
  of computer vision. Often, the objective is to align image pairs from the same semantic
  category for manipulation or segmentation purposes. Despite achieving superior performance,
  existing deep learning alignment methods cannot cluster images; consequently, clustering
  and pairing images needed to be a separate laborious and expensive step.
