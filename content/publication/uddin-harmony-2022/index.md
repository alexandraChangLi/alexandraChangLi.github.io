abstract: In many real-life image analysis applications, particularly in biomedical
  research domains, the objects of interest undergo multiple transformations that
  alters their visual properties while keeping the semantic content unchanged. Disentangling
  images into semantic content factors and transformations can provide significant
  benefits into many domain-specific image analysis tasks. To this end, we propose
  a generic unsupervised framework, Harmony, that simultaneously and explicitly disentangles
  semantic content from multiple parameterized transformations. Harmony leverages
  a simple cross-contrastive learning framework with multiple explicitly parameterized
  latent representations to disentangle content from transformations. To demonstrate
  the efficacy of Harmony, we apply it to disentangle image semantic content from
  several parameterized transformations (rotation, translation, scaling, and contrast).
  Harmony achieves significantly improved disentanglement over the baseline models
  on several image datasets of diverse domains. With such disentanglement, Harmony
  is demonstrated to incentivize bioimage analysis research by modeling structural
  heterogeneity of macromolecules from cryo-ET images and learning transformation-invariant
  representations of protein particles from single-particle cryoEM images. Harmony
  also performs very well in disentangling content from 3D transformations and can
  perform coarse and fast alignment of 3D cryo-ET subtomograms. Therefore, Harmony
  is generalizable to many other imaging domains and can potentially be extended to
  domains beyond imaging as well.
