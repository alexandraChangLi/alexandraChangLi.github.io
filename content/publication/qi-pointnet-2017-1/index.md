abstract: Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its
  irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids
  or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and
  causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly
  consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points
  in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a uniﬁed architecture for applications
  ranging from object classiﬁcation, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing.
  Though simple, PointNet is highly efﬁcient and effective. Empirically, it shows
  strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we
  provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the
  network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.
