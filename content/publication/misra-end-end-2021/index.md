abstract: We propose 3DETR, an end-to-end Transformer based object detection model
  for 3D point clouds. Compared to existing detection methods that employ a number
  of 3Dspeciﬁc inductive biases, 3DETR requires minimal modiﬁcations to the vanilla
  Transformer block. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that a standard Transformer with non-parametric
  queries and Fourier positional embeddings is competitive with specialized architectures
  that employ libraries of 3Dspeciﬁc operators with hand-tuned hyperparameters. Nevertheless,
  3DETR is conceptually simple and easy to implement, enabling further improvements
  by incorporating 3D domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we show 3DETR
  outperforms the well-established and highly optimized VoteNet baselines on the challenging
  ScanNetV2 dataset by 9.5%. Furthermore, we show 3DETR is applicable to 3D tasks
  beyond detection, and can serve as a building block for future research.
