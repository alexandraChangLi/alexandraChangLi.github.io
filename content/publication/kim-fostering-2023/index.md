abstract: 'Abstract  Building trustworthy and transparent image-based medical AI systems
  requires the ability to interrogate data and models at all stages of the development
  pipeline: from training models to post-deployment monitoring. Ideally, the data
  and associated AI systems could be described using terms already familiar to physicians,
  but this requires medical datasets densely annotated with semantically meaningful
  concepts. Here, we present a foundation model approach, named MONET ( M edical c
  ON cept r ET riever), which learns how to connect medical images with text and generates
  dense concept annotations to enable tasks in AI transparency from model auditing
  to model interpretation. Dermatology provides a demanding use case for the versatility
  of MONET, due to the heterogeneity in diseases, skin tones, and imaging modalities.
  We trained MONET on the basis of 105,550 dermatological images paired with natural
  language descriptions from a large collection of medical literature. MONET can accurately
  annotate concepts across dermatology images as verified by board-certified dermatologists,
  outperforming supervised models built on previously concept-annotated dermatology
  datasets. We demonstrate how MONET enables AI transparency across the entire AI
  development pipeline from dataset auditing to model auditing to building inherently
  interpretable models.'
