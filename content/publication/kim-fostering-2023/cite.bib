Building trustworthy and transparent image-based medical AI systems requires the ability to interrogate data and models at all stages of the development pipeline: from training models to post-deployment monitoring. Ideally, the data and associated AI systems could be described using terms already familiar to physicians, but this requires medical datasets densely annotated with semantically meaningful concepts. Here, we present a foundation model approach, named MONET (

Dermatology provides a demanding use case for the versatility of MONET, due to the heterogeneity in diseases, skin tones, and imaging modalities. We trained MONET on the basis of 105,550 dermatological images paired with natural language descriptions from a large collection of medical literature. MONET can accurately annotate concepts across dermatology images as verified by board-certified dermatologists, outperforming supervised models built on previously concept-annotated dermatology datasets. We demonstrate how MONET enables AI transparency across the entire AI development pipeline from dataset auditing to model auditing to building inherently interpretable models.},
