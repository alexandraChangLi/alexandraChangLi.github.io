abstract: Existing domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) methods in object
  detection enforce feature alignment in the visual space but face challenges like
  object appearance variability and scene complexity, which make it difficult to distinguish
  between objects and achieve accurate detection. In this paper, we are the first
  to address the problem of semi-supervised domain generalization by exploring vision-language
  pre-training and enforcing feature alignment through the language space. We employ
  a novel CrossDomain Descriptive Multi-Scale Learning (CDDMSL) aiming to maximize
  the agreement between descriptions of an image presented with different domain-specific
  characteristics in the embedding space. CDDMSL significantly outperforms existing
  methods, achieving 11.7% and 7.5% improvement in DG and DA settings, respectively.
  Comprehensive analysis and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our method,
  positioning CDDMSL as a promising approach for domain generalization in object detection
  tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/sinamalakouti/CDDMSL.
