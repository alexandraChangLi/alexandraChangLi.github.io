abstract: The number of melanoma diagnoses has increased dramatically over the past
  three decades, outpacing almost all other cancers. Nearly 1 in 4 skin biopsies is
  of melanocytic lesions, highlighting the clinical and public health importance of
  correct diagnosis. Deep learning image analysis methods may improve and complement
  current diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. The histologic evaluation of melanocytic
  lesions, including melanoma and its precursors, involves determining whether the
  melanocytic population involves the epidermis, dermis, or both. Semantic segmentation
  of clinically important structures in skin biopsies is a crucial step towards an
  accurate diagnosis. While training a segmentation model requires ground-truth labels,
  annotation of large images is a labor-intensive task. This issue becomes especially
  pronounced in a medical image dataset in which expert annotation is the gold standard.
  In this paper, we propose a two-stage segmentation pipeline using coarse and sparse
  annotations on a small region of the whole slide image as the training set. Segmentation
  results on whole slide images show promising performance for the proposed pipeline.
