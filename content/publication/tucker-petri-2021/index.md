abstract: With the rise of deep learning, there has been increased interest in using
  neural networks for histopathology image analysis, a ﬁeld that investigates the
  properties of biopsy or resected specimens traditionally manually examined under
  a microscope by pathologists. However, challenges such as limited data, costly annotation,
  and processing high-resolution and variable-size images make it difﬁcult to quickly
  iterate over model designs.
