 abstract = {With the rise of deep learning, there has been increased interest in using neural networks for histopathology image analysis, a ﬁeld that investigates the properties of biopsy or resected specimens traditionally manually examined under a microscope by pathologists. However, challenges such as limited data, costly annotation, and processing high-resolution and variable-size images make it difﬁcult to quickly iterate over model designs.},
