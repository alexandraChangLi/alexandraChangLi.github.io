abstract: Invasive melanoma, a common type of skin cancer, is considered one of the
  deadliest. Pathologists routinely evaluate melanocytic lesions to determine the
  amount of atypia, and if the lesion represents an invasive melanoma, its stage.
  However, due to the complicated nature of these assessments, inter- and intra-observer
  variability among pathologists in their interpretation are very common. Machine-learning
  techniques have shown impressive and robust performance on various tasks including
  healthcare. In this work, we study the potential of including semantic segmentation
  of clinically important tissue structure in improving the diagnosis of skin biopsy
  images. Our experimental results show a 6% improvement in F-score when using whole
  slide images along with epidermal nests and cancerous dermal nest segmentation masks
  compared to using whole-slide images alone in training and testing the diagnosis
  pipeline.
