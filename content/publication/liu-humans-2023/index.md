abstract: The relatively hot temperature of the human body causes people to turn into
  long-wave infrared light sources. Since this emitted light has a larger wavelength
  than visible light, many surfaces in typical scenes act as infrared mirrors with
  strong specular reﬂections. We exploit the thermal reﬂections of a person onto objects
  in order to locate their position and reconstruct their pose, even if they are not
  visible to a normal camera. We propose an analysis-by-synthesis framework that jointly
  models the objects, people, and their thermal reﬂections, which combines generative
  models with differentiable rendering of reﬂections. Quantitative and qualitative
  experiments show our approach works in highly challenging cases, such as with curved
  mirrors or when the person is completely unseen by a normal camera.
