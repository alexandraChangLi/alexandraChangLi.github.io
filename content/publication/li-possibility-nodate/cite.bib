 abstract = {Deep learning has played an essential part in the process of technological development. With assistance from deep learning algorithms, AI agents can perform like humans in various tasks, leading to the research towards applying deep learning to other ﬁelds. The development in medical imaging devices has provided researchers plenty of medical images. Both factors led to technological developments in the medical image segmentation ﬁeld. However, there are many barriers to the research in medical image segmentation algorithms. After introducing the background and basic knowledge of medical image segmentation tasks, we provide a new way of categorizing these challenges based on these datasets’ scale. This dissertation also discusses four challenges that the research of medical image segmentation algorithms faces, in the sequence of data access, data annotation, deep learning models’ application, and the variance of datasets, in aspects of ethics and technology. Then, we discuss the probability of developing a universal algorithm that can achieve state-of-the-art performances on all datasets by analyzing previous works. We also conducted experiments based on four powerful 2D image segmentation models and two medical image datasets to prove our opinion. At last, we propose a future working direction for developing a universal algorithm in the medical image segmentation ﬁeld.},
