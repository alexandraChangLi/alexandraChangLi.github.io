abstract: Deep learning has played an essential part in the process of technological
  development. With assistance from deep learning algorithms, AI agents can perform
  like humans in various tasks, leading to the research towards applying deep learning
  to other ﬁelds. The development in medical imaging devices has provided researchers
  plenty of medical images. Both factors led to technological developments in the
  medical image segmentation ﬁeld. However, there are many barriers to the research
  in medical image segmentation algorithms. After introducing the background and basic
  knowledge of medical image segmentation tasks, we provide a new way of categorizing
  these challenges based on these datasets’ scale. This dissertation also discusses
  four challenges that the research of medical image segmentation algorithms faces,
  in the sequence of data access, data annotation, deep learning models’ application,
  and the variance of datasets, in aspects of ethics and technology. Then, we discuss
  the probability of developing a universal algorithm that can achieve state-of-the-art
  performances on all datasets by analyzing previous works. We also conducted experiments
  based on four powerful 2D image segmentation models and two medical image datasets
  to prove our opinion. At last, we propose a future working direction for developing
  a universal algorithm in the medical image segmentation ﬁeld.
