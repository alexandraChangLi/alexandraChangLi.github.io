abstract: We present a new approach for modeling and rendering existing architectural
  scenes from a sparse set of still photographs. Our modeling approach, which combines
  both geometry-based and imagebased techniques, has two components. The ﬁrst component
  is a photogrammetric modeling method which facilitates the recovery of the basic
  geometry of the photographed scene. Our photogrammetric modeling approach is effective,
  convenient, and robust because it exploits the constraints that are characteristic
  of architectural scenes. The second component is a model-based stereo algorithm,
  which recovers how the real scene deviates from the basic model. By making use of
  the model, our stereo technique robustly recovers accurate depth from widely-spaced
  image pairs. Consequently, our approach can model large architectural environments
  with far fewer photographs than current image-based modeling approaches. For producing
  renderings, we present view-dependent texture mapping, a method of compositing multiple
  views of a scene that better simulates geometric detail on basic models. Our approach
  can be used to recover models for use in either geometry-based or image-based rendering
  systems. We present results that demonstrate our approach’s ability to create realistic
  renderings of architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the original photographs.
