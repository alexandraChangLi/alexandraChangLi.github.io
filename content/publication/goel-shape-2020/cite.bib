 abstract = {Reconstructing object geometry and material from multiple views typically requires optimization. Differentiable path tracing is an appealing framework as it can reproduce complex appearance effects. However, it is difﬁcult to use due to high computational cost. In this paper, we explore how to use differentiable ray tracing to reﬁne an initial coarse mesh and per-mesh-facet material representation. In simulation, we ﬁnd that it is possible to reconstruct ﬁne geometric and material detail from low resolution input views, allowing high-quality reconstructions in a few hours despite the expense of path tracing. The reconstructions successfully disambiguate shading, shadow, and global illumination effects such as diffuse interreﬂection from material properties. We demonstrate the impact of different geometry initializations, including space carving, multi-view stereo, and 3D neural networks. Finally, with input captured using smartphone video and a consumer 360◦ camera for lighting estimation, we also show how to reﬁne initial reconstructions of real-world objects in unconstrained environments.},
