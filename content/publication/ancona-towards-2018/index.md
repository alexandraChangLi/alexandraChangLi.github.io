abstract: Understanding the ﬂow of information in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a
  challenging problem that has gain increasing attention over the last few years.
  While several methods have been proposed to explain network predictions, there have
  been only a few attempts to compare them from a theoretical perspective. What is
  more, no exhaustive empirical comparison has been performed in the past. In this
  work, we analyze four gradient-based attribution methods and formally prove conditions
  of equivalence and approximation between them. By reformulating two of these methods,
  we construct a uniﬁed framework which enables a direct comparison, as well as an
  easier implementation. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, called Sensitivity-n
  and test the gradient-based attribution methods alongside with a simple perturbation-based
  attribution method on several datasets in the domains of image and text classiﬁcation,
  using various network architectures.
