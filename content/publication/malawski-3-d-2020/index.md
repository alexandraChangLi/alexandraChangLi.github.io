abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel fault-tolerant parallel matrix multiplication
  algorithm called 3D Coded SUMMA that achieves higher failure-tolerance than replication-based
  schemes for the same amount of redundancy. This work bridges the gap between recent
  developments in coded computing and fault-tolerance in high-performance computing
  (HPC). The core idea of coded computing is the same as algorithm-based fault-tolerance
  (ABFT), which is weaving redundancy in the computation using error-correcting codes.
  In particular, we show that MatDot codes, an innovative code construction for parallel
  matrix multiplications, can be integrated into three-dimensional SUMMA (Scalable
  Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm [30]) in a communicationavoiding manner.
  To tolerate any two node failures, the proposed 3D Coded SUMMA requires ∼50% less
  redundancy than replication, while the overhead in execution time is only about
  5–10%.
