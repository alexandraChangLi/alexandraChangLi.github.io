abstract: Given two images depicting a person and a garment worn by another person,
  our goal is to generate a visualization of how the garment might look on the input
  person. A key challenge is to synthesize a photorealistic detailpreserving visualization
  of the garment, while warping the garment to accommodate a significant body pose
  and shape change across the subjects. Previous methods either focus on garment detail
  preservation without effective pose 1Work done while author was an intern at Google.
